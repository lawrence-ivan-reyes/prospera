### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Program Description
**Prospera** is a personalized job search platform inspired by Tinder's swipe feature, designed to help you find your ideal career path. When you first sign up, you'll answer a series of questions about your professional background, career goals, education, years of experience, preferred industries, workplace values, hard and soft skills, and more. Based on your answers, Prospera matches you with jobs tailored to your profile. You can then 'match' with positions you're interested in or 'skip' those you're not, just like swiping on Tinder. It's a streamlined and interactive way to discover career opportunities that align with your goals.

*This program is heavily inspired by [Welcome to the Jungle](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en).*
